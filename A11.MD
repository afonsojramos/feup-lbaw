# A11: Presentation
 
 
## 1. Product presentation
 

University students needed a place from which to learn more about where to go for their Erasmus mobility. Students also needed a place in which to share their experiences so that they feel socially satisfied. We built it, and its name is _Vecto_.
We developed _Vecto_ as a web application, user friendly and multi-platform, simple and intuitive. 
Using Laravel and all the good things it brings Students can post, comment, vote, search, and socialize with an emphasis on their university mobility. Administrators can use a god-view of the system and act when necessary, collect metrics and analyze if everything is running smoothly.
