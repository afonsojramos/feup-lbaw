# A1: ***VECTO***


The goal of this project is twofold. First, to create an online community aimed at assisting future ERASMUS students with relevant information and real stories of their potential destinations. Second, to allow ex-ERASMUS students to have a way of sharing their experience and feel fulfilled by helping others. The project should consist of the specification, implementation and promotion of a web-based information system for the above goals. Furthermore, we intend to provide a RESTful API (side by side with the web platform) to grant access to other applications that would like to use our information.

There comes a time when every student grasps to search for more information about the several faculties to them available within the ERASMUS program. Our own is not far away, and to try to simplify and aggregate the available information we will ease this access by providing a platform that gives students a simple way to provide their own experience during the program duration, as we would like to have already.

The proposed platform will be user friendly and provide good UX (User eXperience) and UI (User Interface). This will be true for all environments: Desktop, tablet, smartphone. The technologies used will allow for intuitive navigation, and ours should follow REST principles. Good SEO (Search Engine Optimization) practices will also be applied throughout. In terms of specific platform functionalities we intend to implement a good security, performance and robustness wise website with easy access to posts relative to an Erasmus trip within a Faculty within a University, if possible as well as allowing the Administrators to manage information within it. These posts are created by the Authenticated users on the learning establishment and will allow for fellow students to comment and collaboratively discuss their experiences. We also intend to allow other websites to access information within the website using our own API to create modular displays of information for, for intance, displaying the average beer price within a country from its statistics page.

Users of the platform are separated according to their level of access. There are three types of users ranging from a Visitor, that can view the public content of the website, from news/stories to comments and public profiles of Authenticated users; Authenticated, which after logged in, this user has the possibility not to only view the public content of the website, but also publish news/stories and comment posts; to an Administrator, which have the ability to manage (edit/delete) content produced by any other user. They can also manage information pertaining to the faculties.

In terms of platform functionalities we intend to implement an good security, performance and usability wise website with easy access to posts relative to an Erasmus trip within a Faculty within a University, if possible as well as allowing the Administrators to manage Faculties as well as Universities information. We also intend to allow other websites to access information within the website using our own API. A statistics page will also be available to, for example, access the average beer price within a country.
