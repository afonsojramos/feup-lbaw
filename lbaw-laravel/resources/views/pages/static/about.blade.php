			The goal of this project is twofold. First, to create an online community aimed at assisting future ERASMUS students with
			relevant information and real stories of their potential destinations. Second, to allow ex-ERASMUS students to have a
			way of sharing their experience and feel fulfilled by helping others. The project should consist of the specification,
			implementation and promotion of a web-based information system for the above goals. Furthermore, we intend to provide
			a RESTful API (side by side with the web platform) to grant access to other applications that would like to use our information.
		</dl>
		<dl>
			There comes a time when every student grasps to search for more information about the several faculties to them available
			within the ERASMUS program. Our own is not far away, and to try to simplify and aggregate the available information we
			will ease this access by providing a platform that gives students a simple way to provide their own experience during
			the program duration, as we would like to have already.
